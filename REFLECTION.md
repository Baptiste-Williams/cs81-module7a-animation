# Module 7A Reflection

## What part of the code was most confusing and why?
The part with `index % frames.length` was weird at first. I didn’t get why it was needed until I saw that it just keeps the emoji loop going without crashing when it runs out of frames. Makes sense now.

## How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?
It showed how stuff updates on a timer without freezing the page. The emoji kept changing and the browser didn’t slow down, which helped me understand how JavaScript handles things in the background while everything else keeps working.

## What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?
I added a background color switcher during the animation. It made the page more interesting and helped show the loop timing more clearly. Now it looks more like something’s happening in real time, not just waiting. It felt like a little light show while I was waiting in the waitning room.
